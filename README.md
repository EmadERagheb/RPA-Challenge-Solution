Repository Name: RPA-Challenge-Solution

Description:

This repository hosts the code for an automated solution to the RPA Challenge, a web application designed to test and improve robotic process automation (RPA) skills. The challenge requires the participant to programmatically fill out a form as quickly as possible, with the added twist that form fields dynamically change their position on the page after each submission.

Key Features:

Dynamic Selector Handling: Implements a robust method to locate and interact with form fields that change position with each data entry.
Spreadsheet Processing: Includes a workflow to read data from an Excel spreadsheet and map it correctly to the form regardless of field order.
Speed Optimization: Optimized for speed to improve time taken for each submission round.
Error Handling: Provides graceful error recovery and logging to handle and debug issues during the form filling process.
Technologies Used:

RPA Tool/Framework (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, Robot Framework)
Programming Language (if applicable, such as Python or VBScript)
Getting Started:

Detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, dependencies, and how to run the code for the RPA challenge.
Instructions for how to configure the workflow to suit individual RPA Challenge setups or different challenges.
